The parallels between the ANC and the Sicilian Mafia are glaring. The ANC has always been run by a few "families" who treat the state as 'turf' ; as just one big piggy bank for their self-enrichment. The government basically believes we all just work for them. They aren't a democratic government at all, but use the appearances of democracy to give their entitlement practices a mask of legitimacy. The poor and ignorant have been fooled for so long, but people are slowly coming to the ANC for what it is: a self-serving Mafia!

Intel Community: ‘How can we work for a President who Undermines our work?’

Days before taking office, he compared America’s spies to Adolf Hitler’s Gestapo.

American spies do not like having their work dismissed by the president. Nor do they appreciate comparisons to Nazi Germany.

Former CIA Director John Brennan made it clear: “The person who said that should be ashamed of himself,” Brennan said.

Coats’ predecessor, Gen. James Clapper, called Trump’s comments “a terrible, insulting affront … completely inappropriate.”

Trump’s opinions are out of step with the conclusions of the agencies he is supposed to be leading.

Not surprising in a treasonous traitor.

I'd bet that the overwhelming majority of illegal aliens in this country have some sort of documents. But I know - using the euphemism "undocumented immigrants" sounds so much better, if one is here in violation of our laws.

Still, I agree with you. Those who are here lawfully, having gone through the immigration process and been approved, should be allowed to stay. But wait - that's the present case.

I'm still waiting for those who advocate yet another amnesty (if you are old enough, recall the last, "final" amnesty that Reagan singed into law in 1986 - the one that would put an end to illegal immigration) to tell us how they would explain this to all those patient hopefuls standing in line for years and doing the right thing by our immigration laws.

Parents need to write a letter to the top head of the California Board of Education and the local police department to see if criminal charges are warranted. If no can do, write to their State legislature and maybe the State Senators and Representatives. Try FBI. If no results, go for a tort lawyer. Gonna be a long hunt for one. They never tell you why they won't take your case. Really baffling. Be prepared to be disappointed. Civil rights are only for the rich and government employees on Capitol Hill. We are just foolish suckers who believe they represent the laws.

No, the point isn't to be an average team that has a hot streak somewhere in the season that gives them a record where they barely hang on and steak into the playoffs.  The point is to be a good team PERIOD that can win most of their games not just during a hot streak anomaly, but throughout most of the season and in the playoffs.  You seem to have completely missed that nuance of my comment.  

Of course it's better to make the playoffs than not make the playoffs.  Of course it's better to have a hot streak than not have a hot streak.  But my point was that aside from that early hot streak, they were an average-at-best team for most of the season.  The early hot streak was the anomaly.  The sub-.500 team we saw after that is what they were for most of the season and heading into the playoffs.

How about, Stop Giving Trump So Much Free Press Every Time He Says Something Stupid?  The "press" is acting like a bunch of simpletons and Trump is cleaning up because of it.

Back in the 60's, populist revolutions were grabbing headlines:  Public action on the part of citizens gained control of a largely free press through direct action, and were able to use the media to disseminate vital information and spread revolutions that affected the way we view the environment, civil rights, and corporate wars---Revolutions that almost upset the balance of power, and made dubious characters like Richard Nixon into flaming liberals out of fear of the populace.

The Powers That Be learned their lesson then, and an increasingly consolidated media has been putting those lessons into effect with establishment-oriented messages and astro-turf movements ever since.  Now it's going the other way with Trump, and our 5th estate has turned into a bunch of drooling idiots.

In your desperate attempt to defend Francis' blatantly cynical manipulation of the laity with his fraud of a commission and dishonest claims of zero tolerance, you create the straw man argument that I somehow blame him for the entire sex abuse scandal.  No rational reading of my post supports this contention.  He inherited the scandal, and is responsible for how he handles it.  So far, he's protected priests from defrocking, failed to meet with victims, accused critics of being leftists and stupid people, has held no bishop accountable and created a commission that has no budget, no power, no mandate and thus can be recognized as a fraudulent attempt to be doing something.

The now deceased shooter appears to be a deranged Bernie Sanders supporter. While the shooter is ultimately responsible for his actions, the mass media, Democrat leaders, and leftist "entertainers" contribute to a divisive, rabid anti-Trump/anti-Republican atmosphere which motivates extremists like this Democrat shooter.

The other big takeaway is that it would have been a massacre had there not been an armed security detail present to return fire and kill the assailant. High ranking politicians (including Democrats) have armed security details, but ordinary citizens do not. Hawaii Democrats deny ordinary citizens their constitutional right to self-defense with firearms, including concealed carry. Hypocrites!

Prayers for the full recovery of those injured in this senseless shooting of legitimately elected officials and Capitol Police officers.

And these are still not enough, they work very hard to invent a way to dig more from our pocket.

It is evident that we will transition from fossil to some other fuel(s) over the course of decades, but that will only happen when the other fuel(s) are economically superior to fossil fuels.  And governments attempting to tax fossil fuels up to an uneconomic price to make the other fuels look attractive is a fool's game.  It amounts to subsidising those fuels that are not yet economic.

This much is evident.  But claiming that Trudeau has wisdom and insight does quite follow.  The man is a fool, repeating his lines by rote.

<Trump was a draft dodger during Vietnam.>
The president is a coward and a hypocrite who not only dodged the draft and avoided any and every opportunity to serve, but also -- as an adult, a businessman, and minor celebrity -- expressed his contempt for those who do serve by describing his sexual promiscuity, while avoiding venereal disease, as his "personal Vietnam" -- "I feel like a great and very brave soldier" said the punk who is now Commander-in-Chief. http://people.com/politics/trump-boasted-of-avoiding-stds-while-dating-vaginas-are-landmines-it-was-my-personal-vietnam/
The flag represents precisely the right to protest peacefully and lawfully; for the POTUS to describe those who exercise that right in vulgar terms and call for them to lose their jobs dishonors the flag and the country and values it represents. It is the protesters, not POTUS, who honor the flag and understand what it represents.

What a bunch of IDIOTS. The most fair and COLLECTIBLE tax is a SALES TAX. 
The success of a tax is if it is widespread, can be enforced easily and is paid by those who actually purchase goods and services. 
The fewer collectors of a tax the better, and there are much fewer businesses to collect a sales tax than there are residents, who may or may not honestly pay an income tax There are a LOT of income tax cheaters and to enforce collection of income tax requires a new State agency. 
Auditing businesses who collect sales tax is very straightforward and very few businesses of any size cheat on sales taxes. 
As a person increases their income, they buy more expensive items, therefore they pay more sales tax, Most states eliminate groceries from sales tax, so as to not unfairly hit the poor, so the sales tax is on items people CHOOSE to buy. Rich people buy planes, expensive cars, expensive homes, expensive "toys", remodel homes, buy new appliances, etc. and therefore pay more sales tax.

Said it was her 'right'. Sure enough, she was attacked one evening. She fought her assailant off. Never forgot her feminist arrogance. 
Speaking of which...
I can believe you were a lawyer who defended such idiots.

Affront to survivors?!?!

Hillary is 100% correct!

The Media had already prepared their glossy covers with her crown in place--

The media still betrayed her--They could NOT ignore (as they had intended) the Republican candidate despite their orders--Trump played them like PT Barnum and they dutifully kept him FRONT and CENTER in the headlines--even trying to ridicule him as they did, Trump's name was in the news daily and the "deplorables" (those ignored by the mainstream parties) who were themselves "mad as hell" voted their disgust of party politics--hah, hah

Doesn't all the evidence there now is grab your attention? Or are you simply one who thinks it is a conspiracy and that the investigation should be halted immediately. At the end of this, the people of the U.S.A. will not be "thinking" much about this single leak we are talking about.

I can't believe in a great country like this these are the best citizens we can find to represent our country to the free world. Both are childish and corrupt. I feel so sad for us. Trump is a conman. He has made and lost millions this way. That's all he knows. Hillary is a child. She will never truly take responsibility for anything. Trump is ultra right. Hillary is ultra left. We have no moderate. How can I make a choice with only these people. No 3rd party candidate has ever been elected to president to my knowledge. I saw an article somewhere that had 30 reasons Trump should not be president. Then it turned around and gave 30 reasons why Hillary should not be president. Trump's problems have been brought out and we all know every one of them. Hillary has a whole lot I had forgotten about. But both of them are not fit to be president according to the comparison. Only upset both parties have not done a reset and start over. Truthfully this is a Pandora box for both of them.

The best thing Canada can do for its high tech industries is to vote out the likes of Junior, Wynne and Notley..  They are doing more to hurt the high tech and manufacturing industries that help it. They have imposed higher taxes on Canada's highest income earners.  Paying over 50% of your income on taxes is insane.   That effects skilled high tech entrepreneurs, managers, engineer, IT programmers, etc.  Already, the U.S. taxation is far lower for well-paid high tech staff.  More so for other countries like Ireland, Singapore, Hong Kong, etc.  That gap is going to get wider as Trump is going to lower taxes.  It now looks like Junior may impose higher capital gains taxes which again is stupid as many high tech staff count stock share options as part of their pay.    Combine that with carbon taxes and high energy bills.  .  That also badly effects manufacturing. Trudeau, Wynne and Notley are running huge deficits with no end in sight.  There is no end in sight with their stupidity.

Dumb because it is obvious Assad never used chemical weapons.  It is clearly the rebels that have used chemical weapons, and not Assad.  Assad has a vast superiority in weapons, so has no need to resort to cheap weapons like chemical weapons, that are not very effective or easy to aim.  The rebels are the ones who don't have good weapons and have always been improvising alternatives like chemical weapons.  The UN can send in inspectors whenever they want, and they have never found any chemical weapons being used or possessed by Assad.  Why would Assad have turned over all his chemical weapons in 2013 if he intended to still use them?  Why would he bother using them at all, since he has much more lethal weapons?

You missed the point of the article.  The point is that, in this brand new age of phone cameras, social media, and other technology, NO ONE really knows what the right way to handle these tricky situations is.

Based on the article--if you have high school-level reading skills--none of the adults at the school were trying to browbeat the kid, none were trying to intimidate him.  Even the cop, who may have been the toughest on the kid, told him he could avoid having to go to court.

My concern is not necessarily about the science or having policies in place to protect our environment.  My problem is with how you go about doing it.  The Paris Accord assumes all countries will comply with the pledges they made even tho there's no consequences if they don't.  Look at NATO.  Out of 28 countries, only 5 contributed to their defense as promised.  There are no consequences for the other 25 countries that violate the agreement.  Out of 194 countries in the Paris Accord, how many would you guess will comply with the agreement?  The U.S. for sure, because like NATO we are the stupid rich kid.

Cut everything that affects others, but clutch your special legislative privileges with a death grip.

You're a "Conservative"? Ha! Well, let's take a look at your brand of "conservatism". First, you received tax-free per diem far in excess of your expenses every legislative day for two years, without any attempt to stop this fleecing of Alaskans. As you should well know, other state employees on long-term travel receive a flat $78/day, regardless of their food and lodging expenses. Special are you?

And poor you, having to maintain a home while you're away, not doing your job. Really? Did you even think before you wrote this?

Speaking of this, Alaskans elected and paid you to perform your  legislative job EACH and EVERY day of the legislative session(s), not to skip off to Europe, "excused" or not. Pay us back for that, too.

You (supposedly) can't keep track of your own income, and you are in charge of the state's?

1. You're an idiot. I said nothing about medical care, and I wasn't talking about hunter/gatherers. It is a FACT that the first plastered walls were built by the SAME early farmers who also built the first grain stores. Agriculture allowed, for the first time, overproduction of food - so working for a few months a year would provide food for the rest of the year. Plaster was a major thing - it has ZERO survival value. It takes days of backbreaking labour, maintaining a fire at very high heat constantly - for no reward other than aesthetics. It's something that would never have happened in a society without an abundance of leisure time. And it's important that it did - the same fire-handling techniques they developed to make their walls smooth - was what allowed their grandchildren to smelt ore and end the stone age.
2. Yawn. I would have cared if it was related to the topic. Still a strawman.

So yes Richard, you are a racist not because you speak frankly about the news, but because you cannot see past their color and are willing to blame an entire population for the choices of a few individuals. You are no better than BLM protesters who claim all whites are racist because the KKK exists, and actually you are much worse, because you are compounding a false narrative of white superiority that has plagued and eaten away at our democracy like a cancer since it's inception.

You seriously expected one man to end racism and partisanship? You expected that the very first iteration of a national health care law would be anywhere close to perfect? You thought that this one guy could save the declining middle class.

And you thought that he could do all this with the entire Republican establishment, including a majority of the house and a filibustering minority in the senate, standing up and blocking everything Obama did.

So, you were expecting Obama to be magical.

And you decided that voting for the folks who blocked everything he tried to do would be a good idea.

Wow. You really are an complete and total idiot lady. How is it you keep breathing?

- Support for Alberta's industry that produces oil and gas:  BAD
- Support for Ontario's auto industry that burns oil and gas: GOOD

The anti-Alberta venting in the G&M comments over the past year or more has been difficult to understand.  The province has paid tens of billions of extra dollars in equalization payments  which have subsidized social programs in other provinces, yet the response has been "Make them pay PST too".

What a crap piece of journalism! So white (particularly male) people have now to be apologetic of their "privileged" position in life?
With this type of reporting one should not be surprised that the "white man" feels threatened and that populist movements in Europe and USA will be further 
on the rise. 

First of all there are numerous non-white role models in our society, like Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King, president Obama, or Malala Yousafzai. The fact that 12 year old children don't list these people has more to do with what they watch and read today. Don't forget "Bollywood" which is a bigger film industry then Hollywood and generates (non-white) role models for billions of people. 

Canada has provided non-white people opportunities which they would not always have had in their home countries. Canada is a great country because we welcome these people and allow them to pursue their dreams. However, we should not start creating divide between white and non-white people.

Obamacare is not insurance but a bastardized version of socialized medicine attached to the insurance industry.  The only reason the insurance industry backs Obamacare is because it was supposed to force more paying customers to swell their ranks.  It also was to cover any losses that they incurred by insuring desperately sick people.  Unfortunately no one wants to pay their premiums until they are diagnosed with a disease or break a bone.  The idiot Democrats also forgot to pass the law guaranteeing payment for insurance company losses.  This billion dollar subsidy is what congress has been doing illegally since the passage of the ACA.  The Republicans want to stop these illegal payments.  
I do understand insurance and this is not insurance.

Then she was beaten by the black guy (obama) and realized that blacks coalesced around Blacks because they are the most racist ethic group.  But women do not all adhere to gender politics. Blacks and gays are higher up on the liberal  totem pole than women. Hillary, the most unoriginal politician in the public eye, uses only focus-group tested cliches. There is no core, to this woman.

Weren't we told over and over that Mexico was going to pay for the wall?

Ever wonder why despite Trump's rhetoric about "locking her up", he decided after the election to move on from prosecuting Hillary?  Have you ever wondered why we're back to Hillary again?

Do you enjoy being played for a fool?

These 'leaders' of Canada need to understand Islam's history.  They may start with Muhammad; a vile person who rapes girls, and claims them as wives.

Oh, yes, I know more about Islam, than the Muslims do! - that its purpose is control - through lies, manipulation and submission of all others by force. No; you cannot say this! - it is Islamophobic! - oh, how dear.   Why cannot we have a fair, and honest discussion, regarding the pitfalls of this horrendous religion? - because the Islamists will shut the conversation down with lies - whatever works...as is the case in Tacqiya.   And, while the conquest of Mecca was just  the beginning...  What about the Ottoman Turk empire? - 1 million slain, for not being Muslim.  And, the conquest of Lebanon? - Christians, and non-believers be damned...No; say NO! to Islam

Let me ground this conversation in the unequivocal statement that the UO embraces free expression as one of its core principles."

Where as of late, Schill signed on the "Blackface" letter condemning a U/O law professor which in effect says " your first Amendment rights does not matter".

Canada is smart but very stupid. The West innovates, Asia copies and then sells it back to us at half the cost because companies don't give a damn where they got it from and CEOs walk away with short term bonuses. Meanwhile we continue to buy iPhones and Galaxy phones while our kids drown in a mountain of debt. This is a short term tactic with long term consequences.

Complete nonsense. This is the same way our asinine prohibition of alcohol ended, one free state at a time, while marijuana was federally illegal. No state is required to mirror or even enforce federal law. If that were the case we wouldn't even need states, the tenth amendment, or any laboratories of democracy. Thankfully the founders were a bit more intelligent than you. We the people have spoken, the prohibition of marijuana is a cancer, and it will be cut from this state like the garbage it is.

Trump sure seems to be able to get away with a lot more bigoted, racist, bullying, and generally offensive statements that most users would be allowed.

Well, maybe not, Twitter seems to set the bar low, and I don't have an account so I'm just guessing, but I read Trump's tweets this morning, with his "Pocohantas" comment on one, and a reference to a human being (albeit not a very nice one, even by Trump's standards) as a "degenerate animal" in another.

To say this sort of thing is un-presidential is a gross understatement, but more to the point it's offensive, and coming from Trump, it's actually dangerous.

On the other hand it's mildly entertaining the way it might be watching a zombie apocalypse versus a threshing machine or something. Sad and brainless.

Liberals support "race politics"  and so close the door on rational debate. Politics becomes a football for racialists and revolutionaries calculating redress and measuring imbalance. Liberals practice birth control, which ensures they will not spread their luciferian doctrines beyond this benighted generation. Liberals thrive on the largess of a functioning society, so of course they do what they can to undermine and dismantle the very civilization that tolerates them.

Liberalism is a disease of the wealthy and idle elites, much as Enlightenment was the disease that spelled doom for the Middle Ages. Every civilization has a healthy ascendancy and a sickly decline. Liberalism is our swan song.

Towards the end of the day we're sitting at our campsite and watch some guy on a quad go off the trail and go tearing through an untouched meadow. 4 of us went running down the hill to yell at him about it. The obligatory answer of "Sorry" came back. You could tell he didn't care, he just got caught. Earlier in the day we'd cleaned up a shooting area of 400+ spent shells and casings that people left behind before we got our own gear out. It's BS like this that ruin it for everyone.

Your claim is completely unsupported. Throwing numbers around doesn't constitute the truth. Raincouver RE board reports that sales overall in June tanked 11.5% y/y and sales was lower by more than 10% from the month before. Detached home sales slumped a hefty 15% and prices were flat.  The story is  about the  misguided dumb Millennial, escalating condo sales higher, hiding a real deterioration in the broader market. Sales-to-listings ratio was 93.2% for condos resulting in bidding wars, but just 24% for detached. You want to know the cause behind Canadian RE market? Look in to mirror dumbass and apologize to Chinese.

No: you inflated sense of yourself not withstanding, you didn't force me to do anything -- any more than I forced you to describe Trump as an a-hole. But you have caused me to change my mind about your claim that you are a lawyer. I think you probably are a lawyer. For you, winning an argument seems more important than telling the truth. For you, threading the needle between "liar" and "bullsh*tter" is more important than acknowledging that Trump's tweet was reckless and irresponsible; that he accused without supporting facts or evidence; that not caring whether something is true is the moral and functional equivalent of lying; that Trump has lied repeatedly in the weeks following the tweet.  You say that you think he's an a-hole; but that's easy and has no content. do you recognize him as reckless and incompetent? Or are you using a-hole as your shorthand for reckless, incompetent and dangerous?
